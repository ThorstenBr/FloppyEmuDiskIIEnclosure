Housing for Floppy Emu's DB-19 plug adapter.

Hints for printing:
* The models should be printed with their flat side facing downwards.
* Prints without supports.
* There are some bulky volumes to firmly hold the plug. I used Cura's stock infill setting (20%).
* The design printed fine with an Ender 3v2 printer, sliced with Ultimaker Cura using stock settings.
* Priting duration is about 2:10 hours (with Ender 3v2).
